 Hi, I’m @ChaosIncarnated. Probably shouldn't have used my gamer tag as my username, but ohh well. To late now. I have always been interested in how computers worked and IT, but as of 08/2021 I have promised myself I am going to give this programing thing my best shot. I am going to start out with python, some basic topics here and there, and see if I can do anything of significance in 6 months to a year. And maybe, just maybe, be able to work somewhere near me as a junior dev.
